# Boat CLI
A simple CLI to start your Boat projects.

## Commands
**Start**: `boat start [directory]`; will clone current Boat starter into the directory you specify.
**Serve**: `boat serve`; will compile and run your code on a static local server.

It's super duper rudimentary but will improve with time.
